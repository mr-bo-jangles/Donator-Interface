The Background Story:
This Programm has been written to provide a Donator Interface at Sourcebans
But there had been a lot of requests to implement other Systems, like Forums.


There are a lot of Integrations aviable now:
Sourcebans - http://www.sourcebans.net/
Basic Donator Interface - https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=145542&highlight=Basic+Donator+Interface
MyBB - http://www.mybb.com/
SMF - http://www.simplemachines.org/


Recommendet Integrations:
You should use the Basic Donator Interface, instead of Sourcebans !
The BDI is very easy to setup and it is made for DONATION and not for BANS
At the BDI you have 9 Donator Levels aviable
At Sourcebans you have only 6 Custom Flags

You should use SMF or MyBB as your Forum-System.
The Integrations for these Systems are more advanced than the integtaion for other Systems (for example: VBulletin)
